# v1.0.1

### Bug fixes

- Recently added results in 'My Games' now display in order of most recently added, rather than alphabetically.
- 'Add Games' results decks will now parse special characters correctly.
- Fixed an issue found with 'F1 2019' in which this game's name had an erroneous space as it's first character (as read from Giant Bomb's database), leading to it preceding the letter 'A' in alphabetical sorting. Catch-all fix in place in the event this happens with any other games.

### Improvements

- Server-side structure improvements.
