# v1.1

### Features

- OpenCritic integration
  - When a match is found via the Giant Bomb API search, a second search is now performed against the OpenCritic API to find that game. Due to OpenCritic's age, this is only relevant to games released after 2014.
  - If a match is found, additional data will be available on the game's page, including the OpenCritic average review score, a YouTube embed of a trailer, and a row of screenshots. These data will not be available if the search cannot find a match.
  - The function that tries to match results across the two APIs requires an exact match, or a close match where roman numerals and numbers may be interchangeable (e.g. Red Dead Redemption 2 matches with Red Dead Redemption II). Where a match cannot be absolutely confirmed, interrogation of the OpenCritic API will cease and the additional data it would usually provide will be unavailable.
